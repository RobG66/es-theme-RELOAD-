 - Added setting to disable boxart / screenshot images for arcade system gamelist views
 - Fixed incorrect text alignment setting causing an ES log error
 - System view will not show favorites text if there are 0 favorites
 - Corrected a few art filenames for auto collections (trackball, spinner)

Ok, there is now a readme here!  

I just finished a little side project here:  https://github.com/RobG66/BatoDoom-Launcher

There's a few more things I want to fix, hopefully soon.
